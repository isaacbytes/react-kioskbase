# react-kioskbase
An experiment building a web-based kiosk user interface written in ReactJS


## Requirements ##
This Kiosk App runs on the browser and should work on most modern browsers. Modern APIs used include:
* `Intl` APIs
* `Intl.DateTimeFormat`
* `Intl.NumberFormat`
* `Intl.PluralRules`
* `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat`

As of 8/20/2019, only Google Chrome supports all these features.
